# Changelog

All notable changes to **veloiq-framework** and **@juicemantics/veloiq-ui** are documented here.

---

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixes

- **Search input text invisible in header** — when `plain_color_base_hex` is
  configured in `veloiq.toml`, the framework injects CSS overrides that force
  all header elements to a single text color. The search `Input` has its own
  background from the Ant Design theme, causing the text to match the background
  in both light and dark modes. Fixed with two layers: (1) CSS wildcard selectors
  now exclude `input`, `textarea`, `.ant-input`, and similar form elements via
  `:not()` so they keep their native theme colors, and (2) `GlobalSearch` sets
  `color: token.colorText` directly on the `Input` as a runtime guard.

- **SQLAdmin NLChat/DbConnector/NLAnswer list crash** — models that use
  `sa_column=Column("jm_eid", primary_key=True)` with a Python attribute name
  different from the DB column name (e.g. `eid` → `jm_eid`) crashed SQLAdmin
  list/detail pages with `AttributeError: 'NLChat' object has no attribute
  'jm_eid'`. The existing fix only patched Jinja2 template globals; the internal
  `_build_url_for` method called `get_object_identifier` via a module-level
  `from X import Y` binding that was not updated. Now monkey-patched across all
  six SQLAdmin modules that import the function by name.

- **SQLAdmin auto-sort crash** — auto-generated admin views that reference a
  sort column defined only as a `column_property` (not a real table column)
  no longer crash on list pages. Sort columns are now restricted to real
  SQLAlchemy `Column` objects.

- **Admin SPA blank page** — the admin single-page application fallback route
  now uses `router.default` instead of `mount` for the static file handler,
  preventing blank pages in certain deployment configurations.

### Improvements

- **Visual polish** — inverted menu header/sidebar
  colors for better contrast, switched the default theme color to teal
  (`#1e708a`), reduced field borders to single lines, and increased page title
  sizes.

### Documentation

- **`import-schema` tutorial** — added TUI/Studio alternatives for every CLI
  step; revised to use CLI/TUI/Studio commands instead of manual edits.

---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-26

### Features

- **Convention-based page overrides for all page types** — drop a
  `custom_show.tsx`, `custom_edit.tsx`, `custom_create.tsx`, or `custom_list.tsx`
  into a model's subdirectory under `pages/<module>/<Model>/` and re-run
  `veloiq generate`. The generator detects the file, registers it in
  `extensions.gen.tsx` under the corresponding resource key, and `App.tsx`
  renders the custom component instead of the default `Dynamic*` page at
  runtime. Extensions can now declare `edit_overrides`, `create_overrides`,
  and `list_overrides` in their manifest alongside the existing
  `show_overrides`.

- **Literal type → dropdowns** — the API-schema generator now detects
  `Literal["a", "b"]` type annotations on SQLModel fields and emits them as
  enumerated dropdown selects in the generated form. Fields with
  `Field(default=...)` also now pre-populate the Create form with the
  declared default value.

- **`DynamicShow` `beforeTabs` slot** — `DynamicShow` accepts an optional
  `beforeTabs?: React.ReactNode` prop rendered between the sticky header
  (breadcrumbs, title, action buttons) and the form tabs. Allows custom show
  pages to place content (e.g. an NL conversation panel) above the Details /
  relation tabs while keeping the standard header chrome.

- **Bulk-read API** — `POST /api/_meta/bulk-read` accepts a JSON array of
  record IDs and returns the full serialized representation for each.
  Serialization flows through the ORM model so relations resolve correctly.

- **Configurable model title fields** (`titleFields`) — models can declare
  which fields compose their display title (e.g. `first_name` + `last_name`),
  with `{model_name}` and `{pk}` tokens supported. Falls back to
  `dc_title`/`__str__` before the first string field.

- **`veloiq import-schema`** — new CLI command with a guided Studio UI that
  imports an existing database schema into VeloIQ module stubs, preserving
  foreign keys, column types, and defaults.

- **Crosstab chart backend renderer** — backend-rendered crosstab charts with
  fixes for 3D and bubble column resolution in Plotly.

### Fixes

- **Security — removed auth-disable escape hatches** — `VELOIQ_AUTH_DISABLED`
  and `auth_enabled=False` are no longer accepted. All authentication,
  role-based access control, and admin guards are always active. New apps must
  run `veloiq migrate` to seed the admin user before first start.

- **UI — inline Plotly charts** — `ExecutableHtml` strips the external Plotly
  CDN `<script>` tag when rendering inline HTML. The sanitized inline init
  script loads Plotly itself, fixing the race where a slow CDN stalled the
  sequential script runner and charts reserved space but never drew.

- **DynamicResource non-array dataSource** — `filteredDataSource`,
  `columnFilters`, crosstab data derivation, and `currentPageData` now guard
  with `Array.isArray()` instead of `|| []`, preventing `TypeError: X.map is
  not a function` on List, Show, Analyze, and crosstab pages.

- **List page search** — uses the `contains` operator so partial text matches
  work in the default list filter, not just exact-prefix matches.

- **Import-schema multi-FK disambiguation** — junction/link models with
  multiple foreign keys are now ordered correctly during import.

- **Solo sections in configured pages** — now span the full grid width instead
  of being constrained to a single column.

- **CLI — `veloiq run`** — works from the repository root, not just the
  `backend/` subdirectory.

- **i18n — `main.tsx` locale override** — scaffolded `main.tsx` now honors
  the `?lang=` query parameter and `localStorage` locale override.

- **NLP — entity title resolution** — entity titles are resolved via
  `build_model_str_label` and PK columns are properly renamed.

### Documentation

- **i18n request-locale behavior** — clarified that the active locale is set
  per-request via `set_request_locale()`, not automatically from
  `Accept-Language` headers. Documented the `StreamingResponse` caveat.

- **`import-schema`, `add-field` view types, and `bulk-read`** — new
  documentation pages for schema import, extended field view types, and the
  bulk-read endpoint.

### Studio

- Model-name dropdowns, searchable combo-box selectors, and token-expiry
  handling in the Studio UI.
- Build Frontend advisory note split into two paragraphs with per-link support.
- IQVigilant production-hardening nudges at five framework touchpoints plus
  advisory when installed-but-disabled.
- JuiceMantics (Commerce Optimization AI) brand promoted across the website,
  Studio, and CLI.
- IQVigilant URL corrected from `iqvigilant.dev` to `iqvigilant.ai` in all
  touchpoints.

## [0.8.5] — 2026-06-16

### Features

- **Dev-mode auto-migration** — `create_veloiq_app()` now calls `_sync_schema()` after
  `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()`. When `VELOIQ_DEV=1`, it detects columns present in the
  model but missing from the database table and issues `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` automatically,
  so adding a field to a model no longer causes a "no such column" crash at request time or
  requires a manual `veloiq db migrate` / `veloiq db upgrade` cycle in development. Outside dev
  mode the function logs a warning and points at the migration commands instead.

### Fixes

- **Auth CRUD routing** — `/user`, `/role`, `/tenant`, `/user_role`, and `/user_tenant` were
  registered without the `/api` prefix, while the frontend's generic dataProvider always
  requests resources under `/api`. New apps showed empty User/Role/Tenant lists with no error
  (the SPA static-file fallback silently served `index.html` for the mismatched path instead of
  404ing). `make_auth_router()` now returns `(auth_router, crud_router)`; the factory mounts
  `/auth/*` unprefixed and the CRUD router under `/api`, matching every other resource.
- **`veloiq new`** — the automatic `veloiq generate` step after scaffolding was invoking
  `python -m veloiq_framework.cli`, a package with no `__main__.py`, so it always failed
  silently. It now locates the real `veloiq` binary (falling back to the sibling of
  `sys.executable` when it's not on `$PATH`). `veloiq new` also now runs `veloiq build`
  automatically afterward, so a freshly scaffolded app's frontend is built and the app works
  immediately with just `veloiq run` — no manual `generate`/`build` step required.
- **UI — `DynamicResource` crash on non-array dataSource** — `filteredDataSource`,
  `columnFilters`, the crosstab data derivation, and `currentPageData` now all check
  `Array.isArray(tableProps.dataSource)` instead of `|| []`. The previous guard only caught
  `null`/`undefined`; other non-array truthy shapes still triggered
  `TypeError: e.map is not a function` in `buildStatsSummary` and `Y.forEach` in `chartData`
  on List, Show, Analyze, and crosstab pages.

---

## [0.8.3] — 2026-06-16

### Fixes

- **Menu rendering** — `CustomSider`, `HorizontalMenu`, `LayoutWrapper`, and
  `CommandCenterPortal` now guard every menu/journey transform with
  `Array.isArray()` checks. Previously, a transient non-array shape from
  `useMenu()` or a 403 from an unlicensed extension's `/api/journeys`
  endpoint (e.g. an installed-but-not-yet-licensed extension) could throw
  `X.forEach is not a function` and crash the whole layout.

---

## [0.8.2] — 2026-06-15

### Features

#### Named Query Creator — zero-code cross-model queries in Studio
A new dev-mode panel on every model's detail page in the Schema Browser lets developers
define cross-model read queries entirely in the browser — no Python coding required.

- **Declarative JSON storage** — queries are saved to `named_queries.json` in the module
  directory alongside `models.py`. The file is committed to source control and loaded by
  the framework at startup and code-generation time.
- **Relation-based JOINs** — joins are resolved via SQLAlchemy ORM relationships, not raw
  SQL. The framework discovers the correct relationship attribute automatically.
- **Field projection** — toggle individual columns from the root model and any joined model.
  Column aliases and display labels are customisable per-query; field types are read-only
  (inferred from the schema to avoid display inconsistencies).
- **Primary key guarantee** — the root model's pk column is always injected into the SELECT,
  ensuring every result row has a valid `eid` for show/edit navigation. The pk chip in the
  field picker is shown as locked and cannot be deselected.
- **Cross-model default filters** — SQL WHERE clauses baked in at query definition time,
  referencing any selected output column by its alias. Supports `eq`, `ne`, `contains`,
  `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`.
- **Multi-field sort** — an ordered list of `{field, asc/desc}` entries, fully applied as
  `ORDER BY col1 ASC, col2 DESC …` at the database level.
- **Auto-generate** — after every create or update, the studio automatically runs
  `veloiq generate` and streams the output. The new resource appears in the frontend as soon
  as generation completes, with no manual step required.
- **Light/dark mode toggle** — a theme toggle added to the Studio sidebar persists the
  preference in `localStorage` and respects `prefers-color-scheme` on first load.

#### i18n translation catalogue endpoint
- Added `GET /i18n/{locale}.json` endpoint served by the framework (no host-app code
  needed). Returns the compiled `.po` catalogue as a flat JSON object for the frontend
  i18n client.
- Added `/i18n/` to the auth-exempt path list so translation requests are never blocked by
  JWT middleware.

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-06-15

### Features

#### VeloIQ Studio — browser-based developer dashboard
A new browser UI mounted automatically at `/veloiq-studio/` by `create_veloiq_app()`.
No host-app changes required; available whenever the server is running.

- **Schema Browser** — module/model tree with field and relation detail. Many-to-one FK
  parent references are shown in the Relations section alongside one-to-many and
  many-to-many ORM relations.
- **Contextual commands** — Add Model appears on the module page; Add Field, Add Relation,
  and Scaffold Page appear on the model page, all pre-filled with the selected context.
- **Add Field** — optional literals (`--options`), default value (`--default`), and
  nullable/required toggle.
- **Add Relation** — relation type selector (`many-to-one` / `many-to-many`) and optional
  min/max item cardinality inputs.
- **Dashboard and Search pages** — view current config and toggle models/fields.
- **Extensions page** — view installed extensions and enable/disable them.
- **Auto-generate** — every successful command automatically runs `veloiq generate` and
  refreshes the schema in the browser without a page reload.
- **Reload recovery** — when `uvicorn --reload` restarts the worker mid-command, the
  studio detects the dropped SSE stream, polls until the server is back, then completes
  the generate and refresh cycle.
- **Access control** — read access requires the `Admin` role; write access additionally
  requires `VELOIQ_DEV=true` in the environment.

### Fixes

- **`add-relation`** — disambiguation check now scopes FK detection to the specific model
  class body rather than the whole file, preventing false disambiguation when sibling
  models in the same file already reference the target table.
- **`veloiq generate`** — aborts immediately (with a clear error message) if
  `configure_mappers()` fails, preserving existing `*Schema.gen.ts` files instead of
  overwriting them with empty arrays.
- **`veloiq run`** — adds `--reload-delay 2` so watchfiles waits 2 seconds before
  reloading, giving multi-file CLI writes (e.g. `add-relation`) time to complete both
  file writes before the worker restarts.

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-14

### Features

#### Model Builder CLI — `veloiq add-model`, `add-field`, `add-relation`
Three new interactive CLI commands let you grow your schema from the terminal
without hand-editing Python files or migration scripts:

- **`veloiq add-model`** — interactively define a new SQLModel class (name, table
  name, fields, base class) and write it directly into the right `models.py`; also
  handles models that live in the same file as existing ones
- **`veloiq add-field`** — add a field to an existing model and immediately run
  Alembic `autogenerate` + `upgrade` so the column lands in the database without
  a separate migration step
- **`veloiq add-relation`** — wire up a FK or many-to-many relation between any
  two models; auto-disambiguates `foreign_keys=` when multiple FK paths exist
  between the same pair of models; TUI integration via `[r]` on any model screen

All three commands are also launchable from the TUI.

#### `veloiq scaffold-page` — custom page overrides
- `veloiq scaffold-page <module> <model>` generates a custom React page component
  (list, show, or both) pre-wired to the framework's data hooks, so you can
  override DynamicList / DynamicShow for any resource without boilerplate
- The scaffold patches `custom_pages.ts` and `App.tsx` automatically

#### `veloiq check` — project health checks
- Scans the project for common issues: missing dashboard config, unindexed search
  models, models without descriptions; reports errors vs. hints with actionable
  suggestions
- Accessible from the TUI home screen and as a standalone CLI command

#### TUI — richer model inspection
- Model detail screen shows the **path to `models.py`**, field defaults, options
  (as `{label, value}[]` objects), and model docstrings
- Many-to-one FK relations now appear in the **Relations** section, not Fields
- Reverse references, endpoint summary, filter, and follow-relation navigation added
- `[a]` shortcut on a model screen opens `add-field` inline
- Horizontal dividers between sections for readability
- Custom page overrides (scaffolded via `scaffold-page`) are listed in model detail

#### Schema generator improvements
- Field `options` are now emitted as `{label, value}[]` typed objects instead of
  plain strings — no manual conversion needed in `{module}Schema.manual.ts`
- Model docstrings and field descriptions flow through to generated TypeScript comments
- Richer field defaults and inherited-base metadata included in generated schemas

#### Friendlier interactive app creation
- The "create new project" form shows each field's effective default as a dim hint
  (`admin`, `veloiq`, ports `8000`/`5173`, etc.) before you type
- **DB type** is now a ←/→ selector; press Enter to type any custom SQLAlchemy dialect
- DB host/port/user/password fields dim out automatically when SQLite is selected

#### Expanded database engine support
- `--db-type` (on `veloiq new` and `veloiq configure-db`) and the TUI selector now
  accept `sqlite`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `db2`,
  `informix`, and any other SQLAlchemy dialect string (e.g. `postgresql+asyncpg`)
- `dialect+driver` forms resolve the default port from the base dialect
- SQLite and PostgreSQL drivers ship with the framework; other engines require their
  driver (`pymysql`, `pyodbc`, `cx_Oracle`, `ibm-db-sa`, `IfxAlchemy`)

### Fixes

- **UI** — relation tables now display the related entity's label instead of raw `eid`/`eid_to` values
- **UI** — config relations resolve correctly by `resourcePath` when `relationName` is absent
- **Alembic scaffold** — `naming_convention` added to `env.py` so constraint names are deterministic across databases
- **Alembic scaffold** — `render_as_batch=True` added so `ALTER TABLE` works on SQLite during migrations
- **Schema generator** — options emitted as `{label,value}[]` objects (was plain strings)

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-11

### Features

#### Internationalisation (i18n)
- `veloiq_framework.utils.i18n_utils._()` — PO-file-based translation helper available in all custom endpoints and repositories
- Locale resolved per request from the `Accept-Language` header; per-catalog caching keyed on file mtime so edits are picked up without restart
- `VELOIQ_I18N_LOCALES_DIR` and `VELOIQ_I18N_DEFAULT_LOCALE` env vars (and matching `VeloIQConfig` fields) control catalog location and fallback locale
- Catalog lookup normalises underscores to spaces and strips extra whitespace, so `_("total_amount")` matches `msgid "total amount"`

#### Utilities package
- `veloiq_framework.utils` — new `i18n_utils`, `data_mgmt_utils`, and `views_utils` sub-modules available for use in custom endpoints and repositories
- `jm_config.ini` defaults wired in; i18n integration configurable via `VeloIQConfig`

#### Schema generator: system fields excluded from UI schemas
- `cwuri`, `creation_date`, and `modification_date` (fields inherited from `StandardEidModel`) are now excluded from all generated TypeScript schemas — they no longer appear as table columns or form inputs
- Fields that should remain hidden can be overridden per-model in `{module}Schema.manual.ts`

#### M2M relation schema generation
- `veloiq generate` now produces full TypeScript schemas for many-to-many relations, including automatic link-table discovery across all modules
- FK back-relations for link tables are filtered from generated schemas to avoid duplicate relation tabs

#### TUI improvements
- Interactive new-app creation from inside the TUI — answer prompts and the framework scaffolds, installs deps, and opens the project automatically
- Various TUI bug fixes

#### Error handling
- `_OrmModelUnavailable` exception raised when a model references a missing table or model class; prevents silent failures in generated API code

### Fixes

- **Primary key access** — `id` and `eid` fields both resolve correctly across CRUD operations
- **Command Center / menu** — many-to-many junction models are excluded from Command Center and sidebar menu
- **Schema generator** — models are matched by exact module path (not `startswith`) preventing cross-module class leakage when module names share a prefix
- **MultiPaneLayout** — panel sizes persist correctly on page refresh; legacy `pane[0]=...` search-param format handled to avoid layout reset

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-05

### Features

#### Modular Extension Architecture
Pip-installable extension packages can now add modules, schemas, frontend pages,
and licensing to any host app **without modifying the host app's code**.

- `VeloIQExtension` base class + `veloiq.extensions` entry-point discovery — an
  extension declares itself in `pyproject.toml` and is loaded at app startup
- `veloiq new-extension <name>` scaffolds a complete extension package; each
  extension ships its own license module (RS256 JWT enforcement with grace period)
- `veloiq add-licensing` scaffolds license enforcement into a host app's own modules
- **Explicit per-app opt-in** via `veloiq.toml` `[extensions] enabled = [...]` —
  only listed extensions load, at both startup and `veloiq generate`, regardless
  of what is pip-installed. Manage with `veloiq extend-package` / `list-extensions`
- Extension frontend delivery: `veloiq generate` copies extension routes, page
  components, and user-menu items into the host app (`extensions.gen.tsx`)
- Per-resource Show-page overrides — extensions can replace `DynamicShow` for a
  specific resource via a generated `extensionShowComponents` map
- Extension user-menu items are grouped into a **Configurations** submenu

#### Journeys in Navigation & Command Center
- Journeys are auto-listed under their owning module in the sidebar and top menu,
  rendered with the Journey Runner icon (`NodeIndexOutlined`)
- Journeys are injected into the **Command Center** (Ctrl+G) via a recursive,
  generic injection pass

#### Crosstab View Types
- New `crosstab` and `editable-crosstab` view types for pivot-style display and
  inline editing of tabular data

#### Configurable Global View Settings — `veloiq.toml` `[views]`
- Tune how `DynamicResource` renders list / show / edit pages across the whole
  app: color schemas, default view types, gallery image sizes, relation row
  limits, action-button position, and more — served to the frontend via
  `GET /config/views`. Every key is optional and falls back to framework defaults

#### Frontend Configuration Context
- `NavConfigContext` exposes the navigation config to any component via
  `useNavConfig()` / `useNavModules()`
- Saved page-layout configurations now render in `DynamicShow` / `DynamicEdit`

#### Generator & CLI
- `veloiq add-module` always scaffolds `custom_api.py` and updates
  `navigation.config.json`
- Schema generator auto-discovers FK back-relations
- `publish-pypi.sh` — version-guarded release script that refuses to publish
  unless the Python and npm package versions match

### Fixes

- Backend error detail is now surfaced in frontend failure notifications instead
  of a generic message
- `DynamicList` reference cells no longer nest `<a>` inside `<a>`
- License enforcement and navigation config corrected for extension modules
- `license` field in `pyproject.toml` now uses an SPDX string

### Docs & Website

- New "Upgrading an existing app" guide in `getting-started.md`
- UI showcase gallery and documentation screenshots added to the website
- Documented the `crosstab` / `editable-crosstab` view types
- Scaffolded apps now pin `@juicemantics/veloiq-ui ^0.6.0`

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-28

### Features

#### Command Center — Ctrl+G
A full-screen command palette and global search portal, triggered anywhere in
the app with **Ctrl+G**.

- Three-column layout: pinned navigation shortcuts, object search results, and command actions
- Fuzzy search across all enrolled models — results are ranked and navigable with the keyboard
- Pinned items and recent history shown in the empty state so common destinations are one keystroke away
- Keyboard-first: arrow keys select results, Enter navigates, Escape dismisses

#### Unified Page Layout Configuration
Dashboard, Show, and Edit pages now have a live drag-and-drop layout builder built in.

- Drag cells to reorder, resize panels, and configure which relations appear on each page
- Layout preferences are persisted per user
- Relations can be configured even when no layout has been explicitly set up yet
- New `CONFIGURE_LAYOUT` permission gates the builder UI: Admins and Managers can
  configure layouts; Viewers see the configured result but cannot change it

#### Interactive Project Explorer TUI — `veloiq` (no arguments)
Running `veloiq` bare inside a project directory launches a curses-based terminal UI
for exploring the full project structure without reading source files.

- Five screens: Home, Modules list, Module detail, Model detail, Search config
- Surfaces modules, models, fields, relations, dashboard cells, search enrollment,
  permissions, and ReBAC status
- Contextual CLI launcher: highlight any action and press Enter to run the corresponding
  `veloiq` command with a Y/N confirmation prompt

#### Three-File Manual Schema Override
`veloiq generate` now produces three files per module instead of one, making it safe
to customize frontend schemas without losing changes on the next regeneration.

| File | Lifecycle | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `{module}Schema.gen.ts` | Always overwritten | Raw generated output from model definitions |
| `{module}Schema.manual.ts` | Created once, never overwritten | Your hand-written overrides and additions |
| `{module}Schema.ts` | Always overwritten | Merged result — what the app consumes |

Override any field property (`showViewType`, `editViewType`, `label`, `options`, `valueColors`),
add virtual fields, or define synthetic models — all changes survive future `veloiq generate` runs.

### Tests

- Added a pytest automation suite (32 fast tests) covering API auth, CRUD endpoints,
  relation traversal, generator file output, and a CLI smoke test (`veloiq new` end-to-end)
- HTML report (`tests/results.html`) and JUnit XML generated on every run
- `run_tests.sh` at the repo root for one-command execution

### Sample App

- Configured rich field view types across all task-manager models:
  currency for cost fields, progress bar for `actual_progress`, star rating for `rating`,
  Markdown for description fields, colored tags for status / priority / role, and
  relative timestamps for `created_at` / `updated_at`
